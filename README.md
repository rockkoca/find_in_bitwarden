# find_in_bitwarden_alfred_workflow
#### Made little improvement from [this version](https://www.alfredforum.com/topic/7228-dashlane-workflow/).


### My version will not start search until the dashlane is in foreground. For the old version, if the mac is in heavy load, the search may fail.

You can [Download workflow](https://github.com/rockkoca/find_in_dashlane_alfred_workflow/raw/master/Find%20in%20Dashlane.alfredworkflow) here.
